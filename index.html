  <h1>We Love Croissants ü•ê</h1>

  <p>
    Croissants are named for their historical crescent shape. The dough is layered with butter, rolled and folded
    several
    times in succession, then rolled into a thin sheet, in a technique called laminating. The process results in a
    layered,
    flaky texture, similar to a puff pastry.
